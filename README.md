# Modeling Funding Rates Using Stochastic Models and Quantifying Risk for BTC Prepetuals 

## 1. Introduction
This project models and predicts funding rates for perpetual contracts using Monte Carlo simulations. It employs Mertonâ€™s jump diffusion for index prices and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for funding rates to derive metrics like expected liquidation time and probability. These figures enhance risk management in perpetual contracts trading.

## 2. Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `plotly`
- `IPython.display`
- `datetime`
- `statsmodels`
- `glob`

## 3. How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the main script in a Jupyter Notebook or directly using a Python interpreter.

## 4. Project Structure
In this directory you will find:
- The project report `Project Report.pdf` detailing the modeling process, the pipeline architecture and the findings.
- The `Data` directory containing the dataset on which this project was conducted.
- The `Pipeline.ipynb` file containing the python pipeline of the project.
- The `Pipeline.html` the HTML version of the pipeline notebook.
