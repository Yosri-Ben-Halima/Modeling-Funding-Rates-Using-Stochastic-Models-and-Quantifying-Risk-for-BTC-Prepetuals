This project models and predicts funding rates for perpetual contracts using Monte Carlo simulations. It employs Mertonâ€™s jump diffusion for index prices and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for funding rates to derive metrics like expected liquidation time and probability. These figures enhance risk management in perpetual contracts trading.
