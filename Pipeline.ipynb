The chosen entry date (`T0`) marks the beginning of the analysis, and the artificial maturity date (`T`) signifies the endpoint of the simulated trading period. The number of contracts purchased (`N`) and the leverage applied (`L`) are critical factors influencing the position's risk and potential returns. The trader's decision to take either a `position` (`Short` or `Long`) indicates their market outlook. Furthermore, the choice of `exchange` is essential, as different exchanges may offer varying terms and funding mechanisms.

    "During the analysis of the global funding rate data (which is constructed in a linear fashion from the funding rates of different exchanges), a distinct mean-reverting pattern became evident. This observation justified the utilization of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process within the Monte Carlo framework, as it accurately captures such reverting behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *`Ornstein-Uhlenbeck`* process is a stochastic differential equation used to model `mean-reverting behavior` in time series data. It is widely applied in finance, economics, and other fields to describe phenomena where values tend to return to a long-term mean or equilibrium value over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OU process is represented by the following `stochastic differential equation`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "dX_t = \\theta(\\mu - X_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t\n",

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "dW_t \\approx W_{t+dt}-W_t \\sim N(0, dt)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $X_t$ represents the process at time t, in our case it is the transformed funding rate $F_t$.\n",
    "- $dX_t$ represents the infinitesimal change in the process at time t.\n",
    "- $\\theta$ is the mean-reversion rate, indicating how quickly the process reverts to the mean.\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the long-term mean or equilibrium value.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the volatility of the process.\n",
    "- $dW_t$ represents a differential of a standard Wiener process (or Brownian motion) at time t, which represents the stochastic noise (or random shocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean-reversion term $~\\theta(\\mu - X_t)~$ ensures that the process tends to move towards its long-term mean μ when it deviates from it. As $X_t$ approaches $\\mu$, the mean-reversion force weakens, allowing the process to fluctuate around the equilibrium value. This process also exhibits stationary increments in the form of the random shocks $~\\sigma dW_t~$, which means that the changes in the process over time have constant statistical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons behind the choice of this process are :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***`Stationarity:`*** The OU process assumes that the underlying time series is stationary, which means it has a constant mean, variance, and autocovariance over time. As we mentioned earlier after conducting tests, the transformed funding rate data is stationary and that aligns well with the assumptions of the OU process, making it a suitable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***`Mean Reversion:`*** The mean reversion estimate is positive and indicates that it tends to revert back to a long-term mean value. The OU process is specifically designed to capture mean-reverting behavior, and the presence of mean reversion in your data further supports the appropriateness of the OU model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***`Economic & Theoretical Justification:`*** BTC perpetual contracts often exhibit mean reversion tendencies in their funding rates. Funding rates are designed to bring the contract price in line with the underlying asset's spot price, and deviations from this equilibrium are naturally corrected over time thanks to its core mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***`Time Homogeneity:`*** The OU process is time-homogeneous, meaning its statistical properties and parameters do not change over time. With a stationary transformed funding rate, the time homogeneity assumption is more likely to hold, further supporting the model's use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ***`Simplicity and Interpretability:`*** The OU process is relatively straightforward to understand and interpret, making it suitable for financial modeling and Monte Carlo simulations.\n",

    "While examining the index price data, two significant characteristics emerged: continuous diffusion and occasional jumpiness. To effectively represent this intricate behavior, the Merton jump diffusion process was selected for modeling within the Monte Carlo simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Merton Jump Diffusion Model describes the dynamics of an asset price, such as BTC in a perpetual futures market, as a combination of continuous diffusion and occasional jumps. The model can be mathematically expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t + dJ_t\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $dS_t$ represents the infinitesimal change in the asset price over a small time interval dt.\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the drift coefficient, representing the expected instantaneous rate of return of the asset.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the volatility coefficient, representing the standard deviation of the asset's returns.\n",
    "- $dW_t$ is the increment of a Wiener process (Brownian motion) at time t, representing the continuous diffusion component.\n",
    "- $dJ_t$ is the increment of a jump process at time t, representing the sudden jumps in the asset price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The jump process $J_t$ is modeled as a compound Poisson process with intensity $\\lambda$, where the number of jumps follows a Poisson distribution, and the jump sizes are independently and identically distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The jump sizes can be assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with mean $J_{\\text{mean}}$ and standard deviation $J_{\\text{std}}$, which accounts for the fact that jumps are often proportional to the asset's current price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons behind using the `Merton Jump Diffusion Model` for simulating `BTC Perpetual Futures' Index Price` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***`Accounting for Jumps:`*** Captures sudden and substantial price movements (jumps) in BTC price, reflecting its high volatility and irregular behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***`Flexibility in Drift and Volatility:`*** Allows separate specification of drift and volatility parameters, enabling adaptation to different market conditions and historical characteristics of BTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***`Incorporating Market Sentiment and News Impact:`*** Includes exogenous events like market sentiment, regulatory news, and macroeconomic factors, which can trigger significant jumps in BTC price.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating both the continuous diffusion and jump components, the Merton Jump Diffusion Model provides a comprehensive representation of the asset price dynamics, capturing the sudden jumps and heavy-tailed distributions observed in cryptocurrency markets like BTC perpetual futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter estimation method for Merton's jump diffusion model is as follows. We start by computing logarithmic returns within index price sequences $S_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{Logarithmic Return: } R_t = \\log\\left(\\frac{S_t}{S_{t-1}}\\right) \\text{for } t \\in [1,n]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we determine the continuous component's parameters which is governed by a Geometric Brownian Motion with a drift parameter $\\mu_{\\text{gbm}}$ and a volatility parameter $\\sigma_{\\text{gbm}}$, using $R_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\mu_{\\text{gbm}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^{n} R_t, \\quad \\sigma_{\\text{gbm}} =  \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^{n} (R_t - \\mu_{\\text{gbm}})^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "By subtracting the continuous drift component from the logarithmic returns, we isolate the effects of jump events and we denote it as $C_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\text{Jump Size: } C_t = R_t - \\mu_{\\text{gbm}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "And then using the jumps, we estimate the mean $\\mu_{\\text{jump}}$ and volatility $\\sigma_{\\text{jump}}$ that intricately govern these ascending perturbations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\mu_{\\text{jump}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t=1}^n C_t, \\quad \\sigma_{\\text{jump}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^n (C_t - \\mu_{\\text{jump}})^2}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally we provide an estimate of the jump intensity $\\lambda$ using the method of moments. We employ enumeration of jumps exceeding a specified threshold (determined via visual inspection of the training set jumps), rendering the jump intensity as the ratio of such jumps to the entirety of the observation time:\n",

    "The analysis of the liquidation pipeline’s outcomes reveals significant in sights into the impact of leverage on risk and liquidation dynamics. As leverage increases, the inherent risk amplifies for both long and short positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This heightened risk is manifested by a decrease in the expected liquidation time as leverage grows. Moreover, the probability of liquidation before the predefined maturity time exhibits an upward trend with escalating leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the relationship between leverage and expected liquidation time is characterized by a convex pattern, where the rate of decrease in expected liquidation time accelerates with higher leverage. Conversely, the probability of liquidation before maturity displays a concave behavior, indicating that the incremental increase in leverage leads to a diminishing rise in the likelihood of early liquidation.\n",

    "The backtesting phase of the liquidation pipeline validates its effectiveness and sheds light on its key strengths and potential improvements. Notably, the comparison between the plots of expected and actual liquidation times reaffirms the accuracy of our methodology. Both plots exhibit similar trends and maintain the same scale, pointing out good insights in this approach. \n",

While the short side demonstrates a notably successful outcome, the long side exhibits decent but not so accurate performance. Recognizing this discrepancy, the primary avenue for future enhancement lies in refining the plots related to the long position."
